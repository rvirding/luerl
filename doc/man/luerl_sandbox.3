luerl_sandbox - Fuctions for sandboxing Luerl evaluation
.SH Interface Functions
.PP
The \f[B]Lua State\f[R] parameter is the state of a Lua VM instance.
It must be created with the \f[B]luerl:init()\f[R] call and be carried
from one call to the next.
.PP
As it is possible in Lua to create self-referencing data structures,
indeed the standard libraries have many instances of this, then using
the functions which decode their return values will generate an error
when they would cause an infinite loop during the decoding.
An simple example is the top level table which contains a key
\f[B]\f[VB]_G\f[B]\f[R] which references the top-level table.
.PP
Note that Lua \f[B]Chunks\f[R] (see definition below) can travel between
different States.
They are precompiled bits of code, independent of State.
That you can `carry around' this is no unique to Luerl but a low-level
implementation detail of the standard Lua language (https://lua.org),
for more on chunks
read (https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#3.3.2) the official Lua
5.3 reference manual (https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html).

.SS Functions
.SS init() -> State.
.SS init([ State | TablePaths]) -> State.
.SS init(State, TablePaths) -> State.
.PP
Create a new sandboxed state.
If a state is given as an argument then that state will be used
otherwise a new default be be generated.
\f[V]TablePaths\f[R] is a list of paths to functions which will be
blocked.
If none is given then the default list will be used.
.SS run(String | Binary) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
.SS run(String | Binary, State) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
.SS run(String | Binary, State, [ MexReds | Flags ]) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
.SS run(String | Binary, State, MexReds, Flags) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
.SS run(String | Binary, State, MexReds, Flags, Timeout) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
.PP
Spawn a new process which runs the string \f[V]String\f[R] in
\f[V]State\f[R] where the default sandbox state will be used if none is
given.
\f[V]MaxReds\f[R] limits the number of reductions and \f[V]TimeOut\f[R]
(default 100 msecs) the time to run the string, \f[V]Flags\f[R] are
spawn options to the process running the evaluation.
