luerl_sandbox(3)           Library Functions Manual           luerl_sandbox(3)

Name
       luerl_sandbox - Fuctions for sandboxing Luerl evaluation

Interface Functions
       The  Lua State parameter is the state of a Lua VM instance.  It must be
       created with the luerl:init() call and be carried from one call to  the
       next.

       As  it  is  possible in Lua to create self-referencing data structures,
       indeed the standard libraries have many instances of this,  then  using
       the  functions  which decode their return values will generate an error
       when they would cause an infinite loop during the decoding.  An  simple
       example is the top level table which contains a key _G which references
       the top-level table.

       Note  that Lua Chunks (see definition below) can travel between differ‐
       ent States.  They are precompiled bits of code, independent  of  State.
       That  you can ‘carry around’ this is no unique to Luerl but a low-level
       implementation detail of the standard Lua  language  ⟨https://lua.org⟩,
       for    more   on   chunks   read   ⟨https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/man‐
       ual.html#3.3.2⟩ the    official    Lua     5.3     reference     manual
       ⟨https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html⟩.

   Spec Definitions
       Binary means an Erlang binary string.
       Chunks means a portion of precompiled bytecode.
       State means a Lua State, this is a Lua VM instance.
       Path means a file system path and file name.
       KeyPath  means  an  Erlang  list  of  atoms  representing nested names,
       e.g. [table,pack] for table.pack.
       Keys means Lua table keys, the keys of a key-value structure.

   Functions
   init() -> State.
   init([ State | TablePaths]) -> State.
   init(State, TablePaths) -> State.
       Create a new sandboxed state.  If a state is given as an argument  then
       that  state  will  be  used  otherwise  a  new default be be generated.
       TablePaths is a list of paths to functions which will be  blocked.   If
       none is given then the default list will be used.

   run(String | Binary) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
   run(String | Binary, State) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
   run(String | Binary, Flags, State) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
       Spawn a new process which runs the string String in State where the de‐
       fault  sandbox  state will be used if none is given.  Flags is a map or
       keyword list which can contain the following fields

              #{max_time => MaxTime,
                max_reductions => MaxReds,
                spawn_opts => SpawnOpts}

       MaxReds limits the number of reductions and MaxTime (default 100 msecs)
       the time to run the string, SpawnOpts are spawn options to the  process
       running the evaluation.

   run(String | Binary) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
   run(String | Binary, State) -> {Result, State} | {error, Reason}.
   run(String  | Binary, State, [ MexReds | Flags ]) -> {Result, State} | {er‐
       ror, Reason}.
   run(String | Binary, State, MexReds, Flags) -> {Result,  State}  |  {error,
       Reason}.
   run(String  |  Binary, State, MexReds, Flags, Timeout) -> {Result, State} |
       {error, Reason}.
       This is the old interface to run.  It still works but the new interface
       is recommended.  Spawn a new process which runs the  string  String  in
       State  where  the  default sandbox state will be used if none is given.
       MaxReds limits the number of reductions and TimeOut (default 100 msecs)
       the time to run the string, Flags are spawn options to the process run‐
       ning the evaluation.
